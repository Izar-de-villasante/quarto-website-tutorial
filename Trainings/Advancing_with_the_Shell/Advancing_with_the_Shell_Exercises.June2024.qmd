```

<br/>

### Exercise 2:

Using a 'for loop' calculate the multiplication series for the number 7 for each 5th instance up to 140 (for example: 1 \* 7 = 7, 5 \* 7 = 35, 10 \* 7 = 70 ... 20 \* 7 = 140).

Answer

``` bash
#
for i in {1..140..4}; do echo $(( $i * 7)); done
```

<br/>

### Exercise 3:

Rename all '.bed' files to '.txt' files.

Answer

``` bash
#
for i in $( ls *bed ); do mv $i ${i%.bed}.txt; done

From the file 'subsample1.bed' extract all lines that start with chr20, chr21, chr22 but not chr2.

Answer

### Exercise 5:

Using 'sed', remove all quotes from a file.

Answer

``` bash
#
sed 's/\"//g' myfile
```

### Exercise 6:

Using 'awk', print the coordinates of all peaks occoring on the plus strand.

Answer

``` bash
#
awk '{if($5=="+"){print $1, $2, $3}}'  peaks.bed
```

Using 'awk', calculate the total of the peak scores for all peaks occuring on the plus strand.

<br/>

Answer

```
