## Exercice 7

1.  Create a bash script file with the following content:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash 
curl -s "wttr.in/$1?m1"
```

2.  Create a bash script to execute the new script inside the lolcow container, within a Slurm batch job. Copy the following sbatch header and **add the command to run the script inside the container**:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash 
#SBATCH --job-name=run_lolcow
```

3.  Use `sbatch` to run the script and check the output. You can use `squeue` to see the progress. You will find the log file in the current folder when the job finishes.
