## Exercice 7

1.  Create a bash script file with the following content:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash 
curl -s "wttr.in/$1?m1"
```

2.  Create a Slurm script to execute the script from step 1 inside the container you made in the previous exercise. Copy the following sbatch header and **add the command to run the script inside the container**. The container will run the command that you type after the image name; therefore, you need to use bash script.sh to actually run the script.

``` bash
#!/bin/bash 
#SBATCH --job-name=run_lolcow
```

3.  Use `sbatch` to run the script and check the output. You can use `squeue` to see the progress. You will find the log file in the current folder when the job finishes.
