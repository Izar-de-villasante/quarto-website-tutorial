|               | Virtual Machines                                                                                              | Container                                                               |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Guest OS      | Each VM runs on virtual hardware and the kernel is loaded into its own memory region.                         | All containers share the same kernel.                                   |
| Communication | Through Ethernet Devices.                                                                                     | Standard IPC mechanisms like Signals, pipes, sockets, etc.              |
| Performance   | Small overhead as the Machine instructions need to be translated from Guest to Host OS.                       | Near native performance as compared to the underlying Host OS.          |
| Startup time  | Takes up to a few minutes to boot up.                                                                         | Containers can be booted up in a few seconds.                           |
| Isolation     | Sharing libraries, files, etc. between guests and between guests and host not natively possible.              | Subdirectories can be transparently mounted and can be shared.          |
| Storage       | VMs usually require more storage as the whole OS kernel and associated programs have to be installed and run. | Containers consume lower amount of storage since the Host OS is shared. |
