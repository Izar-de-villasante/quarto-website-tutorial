### Sudo in docker

Singularity runs with the same user that starts the container while the Docker daemon runs as root.

### Host files access

Default Behavior: Docker isolates the container from the host machine by default. Singularity mounts the /home directory of the user running the container.

::: {.callout-warning title="Side effects of mounting the home directory"}
All user customization files will be in the container when it runs. This can break the isolation/reproducibility concept, such as having user-defined R libraries.

It is recommended to run Singularity with --no-home or even with --containall (-C) and bind only the required directories.
